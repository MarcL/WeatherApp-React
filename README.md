# Weather Test

A simple test application which works with the Yahoo Weather API to retrieve the five day forecast for the chosen city. This is then rendered using Facebook's [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library for fast UI update.

## Running the server
This application uses a simple Node.js server to serve the page and icons. Install the correct NPM packages using:

```
npm install
```

To run the server:

```
npm run start
```

Once the server is running then navigate to [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)
